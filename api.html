This is an exceptionally clean and type-safe interface for sharing data across a wire. But it's not readily replicated outside of DotNet, and it's also been deprecated by Microsoft. REST as a design philosophy has gained enormous momentum, and as such it's achieved generous support and careful consideration on just about every language and platform imaginable.</p><h2> Basic Operation</h2><p>The flow of using the QA401 over a REST interface is straightforward:</p><p>1. Set the operating parameters, such as audio buffer size and windowing types. This is accomplished with multiple PUT operations.</p><p>2. After the desired configuration is achieved, an HTTP POST is issued to start an acquisition. This occurs with the parameters that were specified in step 1.</p><p>3. The user can initiate analysis on the acquired data repetitively until the requirements are met. Note that while you CAN pull over the raw acquired data--either as a time or frequency series--many basic operations, such as computing noise or THD or measuring peak levels can be computed without pulling any raw data from the server.</p><h2>Simple Example</h2><p>As a very simple example, let's look at the HTTP commands you'd use to to make a 1 KHz THD measurement:</p><p>First, we'd want to set Audio Generator 1 'on', at a level of 0 dBV and a frequency of 1 KHz. That is accomplished with the following PUT command</p><p style="background:silver">HTTP PUT localhost:9401/Settings/AudioGen/1/1/1000/0</p><p>Next, we specify we want a 32K FFT buffer size:</p><p style="background:silver">HTTP PUT localhost:9401/Settings/BufferSize/32768</p><p>Then, we kick off an acquisition using a POST:</p><p style="background:silver">HTTP POST localhost:9401/Acquisition</p><p>The POST won't return until the acquisition has completed--generally a few hundred milliseconds. When the POST returns, it doesn't bring any data with it. Instead, the JSON response from the POST command will contain a single value, such as:</p><p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930"}</p><p>All operations will return the same SessionId until the next acquisition is completed. This allows you to ensure the data set you are operating on remains the same.</p><p>We can then ask the server to perform a measurement on the acquired data. For example, to measure the THD on the data we just collected, we'd issue a </p><p style="background:silver">GET localhost:9401/ThdDb/1000/20000</p><p>In response to the above GET, the server would respond</p><p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930", "Left":"-101.929476869617", "Right":"-98.8973249362777"}</p><p>Note in the above we see the same SessionId as before, indicating this is the same set of data. And we can also see the THD values returned for both the left and right channel. If we issued the command again, we'd see the exact same return string since the data the THD computation is operating upon is unchanged (and indicatedby the same SessionId).</p>Note that without the SessionId, it would be possible for an errant acquisition to be started by a 3rd party. While the REST interface doesn't contemplate user accounts or security, it does make it possible to ensure the data you are operating upon is the data you expect. <hr><h1> Returned Data Types</h1><hr>Depening on the operation, the server may return one of 6 data types. All are JSON structures.<br><br><h2 id="EMPTY">EMPTY</h2>An empty return will consists of a JSON structure that contains a single element, which is the Session ID. This would appears as<p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930"}</p>As discussed above, the Session ID for all return types will remain constants across the lifetime of an acquisition.<h2 id="EMPTY">BOOLEAN</h2>A boolean return will consists of a JSON structure that contains two elements: a Session ID and a value that was either True or False. This would appears as<p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930", "Value":"true"}</p>As discussed above, the Session ID for all return types will remain constants across the lifetime of an acquisition.<h2 id="EMPTY">INT</h2>A int return will consists of a JSON structure that contains two elements: a Session ID and a value that is a signed 32-bit int. This would appears as<p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930", "Value":"13"}</p>As discussed above, the Session ID for all return types will remain constants across the lifetime of an acquisition.<h2 id="SCALAR">SCALAR</h2>A Scalar return will consists of a JSON structure that contains a SessionId and a scaler double value. This would appears as<p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930", "Value":"3.1415"}</p>A scalar return type is used when a single double value needs to be returned. An example might be the current software version in use.<h2 id="SCALARPAIR">SCALAR PAIR</h2>A Scalar Pair return will consists of a JSON structure that contains a pair of scalar values. This would appears as<p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930", "Left":"-101.929476869617", "Right":"-98.8973249362777"}</p><p>This return type is useful for returning a left/right pair of measurements. For example, if you asked for the THD to be computed on some acquired data, both the left and right data would be returned. If you are only interested in a single channel, then just ignore the un-needed channel.</p><h2 id="DOUBLEARRAY">DOUBLE ARRAY</h2>A Double Array return will consists of a JSON structure that contains a Session Id, an element named Dx, and two MIME-encoded strings: One for the left channel, and one for the right channel.  This would appears as<p style="background:silver">{"SessionId":"286930", "Dx":"5.859375", "Left":"PElx+QYE", "Right":"Or9Ub8kU" }</p><p>The Dx value represents the spacing of the array data. The MIME-encoded strings represent binary data for the left and right channels. While the return strings above are short for demonstration, in actuality the real strings will be very long--several megabytes in some cases. To decode this data, you need to use the standard functions in your preferred language to convert mime strings to byte arrays, and then assemble those byte arrays into 64-bit doubles. Once you have reconstructed the arrays of doubles, the Dx value tells you the spacing between each value. For example, the above data in the example is frequency bin data, and the spacing between each bin is 5.85 Hz. But you could also pull over the time-domaindata too. In that case, the Dx value would represent the sampling period.</p><p>The C# code used to convert the doubles arrays to MIME strings is shown below. Converting back should be an straightforward exercise.</p><code><p style="background:silver">public override string ToJsonString()<br>{<br>   string l = Convert.ToBase64String(GetBytes(Left));<br>   string r = Convert.ToBase64String(GetBytes(Right));<br>   return string.Format("{{ "SessionId":"{0}", "Dx":"{1}" "Left":"{2}", "Right":"{3}" }}", SessionId, Dx, l, r);<br>};<br><br>byte[] GetBytes(double[] vals);<br>{<br>    var result = new byte[vals.Length * sizeof(double)];<br>    Buffer.BlockCopy(vals, 0, result, 0, result.Length);<br>    return result;<br>};<br></p></code><hr><h1>REST API</h1><hr>
